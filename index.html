        <br>
        <p class= "spacing"> Hi my name is Inniya Santhanakrishnan, and I am a sophomore at UW Madison. I am currently pursuing a double major in computer and information science, hoping to work in the realm of UIUX design in the future.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="spacing"> While I am currently studying at UW Madison, my hometown is in California. I’m from a city called Cupertino, home to Apple’s headquarters. I grew up in the Bay Area and was exposed to the tech industry throughout my life. Although I never imagined entering the tech field, that changed when I started high school. What began as accompanying a friend to a club meeting eventually led to being part of some really fun and exciting coding projects. From then on, I realized my passion for coding and design. I started attending hackathons and working on personal projects. This website is dedicated to showcasing some of those personal projects. </p>

        <h4 class="spacing"> <span>My experience</span></h4>
        <br>
        <p class="spacing">I have over four years of experience in Java, and it is my go-to programming language. However, I am also comfortable with Python and C++. Currently, I am learning frontend development and design. My hope is that by the time I graduate, I will become a well-rounded and versatile full-stack engineer.</p>
